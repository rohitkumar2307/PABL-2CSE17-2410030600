HEAP:
TWO TYPES: 1.min heap
           2.max heap


converting list or array into a heap: 
    n=len(list)
    n/2-1
1.convert array into minheap
2.remove k-1 elements from heap


12.
sort elements
result =a[-1]-a[0]
low tower->+k
tall tower->-k
result should not be negative
compute the possible min difference
to calulate median odd-n//2 even-((n//2-1)-n//2)//2

set in python- data structure which is unordered(no index associated), unchangeable but mutable(only add new data)and no duplicates are allowed
{} for defining set elements {True,2,3,False,[1,2,3],("a","b")}
constructor newset= set(("apple","kiwi","banana"))
empty =set() | print(empty) -> set()  **not {}**
set comprehension
username={"      Sachin","Rohit    ","Prateek  "}
x={user.lower().strip() for user in username}  // aslo known as shorthand method
newset.add("Orange") | newlist(["grapes","strawberry"]) | newset.update(newlist)
update-add multiple data | add-add single data into a set
union (|) 
set.remove()- removes a specific element from a set but if element not found will throw error
set.discard()-same thing but does'nt throw error
set.pop()- deletes random element
set.clear() - empties the set
del newset-deletes data along with variable
MAIN functions associated with set UNION (|), INTERSECTION (&), difference(-) , SYMMETRIC difference(^)(deletes common elements from both) SIMILAR TO (XOR) 
frozonset- a set but like immutable
newset=frozonset({})
