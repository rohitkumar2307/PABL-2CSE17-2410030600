# Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of 
# chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There 
# are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that - 
#       i. Each student gets exactly one packet. 
#      ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and 
# minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum and return that 
# minimum possible difference.
