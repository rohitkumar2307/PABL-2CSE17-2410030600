# You are given an array arr[] of non-negative numbers. Each number tells you the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position. 
# If arr[i] = 3, you can jump to index i + 1, i + 2, or i + 3 from position i. 
# If arr[i] = 0, you cannot jump forward from that position. 
# Your task is to find the minimum number of jumps needed to move from the first position in the array to the last position.
